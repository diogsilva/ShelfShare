### `Human-Computer Interaction Project`

This assignment is aimed at the development of an interactive application prototype following a usercentred design methodology.
The prototype is functional; however, simplifications may be done as the focus of the assignment is on the methods used along the process and the User Interface (UI) and not on having a fully functional application (left out most of backend implementation).

Tools:
-Node.js
-React

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server.js`

Runs the app token for the login procedure.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
